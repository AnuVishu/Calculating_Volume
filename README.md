# Calculating_Volume
HackerRank Problem Challenge

# PROBLEM OVERVIEW:

- Sample Input 1

 2     
 1    
 4     
 4     
 67.89    
 (-98.54)   

- Sample Output 1

 64.000    
 java.lang.NumberFormatException: All the values must be positive

- Explanation:
There are two test cases. In the first test case 1 means you have to calculate the volume of a cube. The next line contains a side of the cube=4, means the side of the cube is 4. So the volume of the cube is 64.000. 
In the second test case ch=4, that means you have to calculate volume of a cylinder. But the height of the cylinder is negative, so an exception is thrown.

- # the solution is correct but is not as per the requirement of the actual problem.
